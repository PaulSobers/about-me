         These are my favorite hobbies : Playing Basketball , Swimming , and Listening to Music. I play basketball because it help keep me active and athletic and im also good at it and i also enojy playing against my friends. 
         Swimming also help keep me in shape because it work uper strength and your legs and the being in the water is also fun which u can do alot in a pool.
         I listen to music because it keeps me calm , anytime i find myself in a situation where i can get mad or be sad i listen to music to keep my emotions in check.
