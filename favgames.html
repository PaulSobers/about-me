        <p>I like these games because they interest me. I find them fun. Black ops 3 fasincate me because i like playing shoooting games and I am very good at it. I play it all the times with my friends. Need for speed connect to me because I like driving and it is very fun but higly annoying because i crash alot when i go too fast so in a way it help me. I like NBA 2k16 because i love to play basketball so making my own myPlayer to do stuff i cant .... yet is very fun. These games help keep me off the streets and keep me busy. If it wasnt for games i would be a totally different person. </p>
